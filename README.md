# Independent performance evaluation of multiple structural variant callers for insertions and deletions on human genomes

This project evaluates four structural variant (SV) callers —**Manta**, **DELLY**, **LUMPY**, and **Breakdancer**— on synthetic human genome data simulated with **SURVIVOR** and **ART**. We would like to investigate how their algorithmic approaches affect performance and usability in detecting **deletions** and **insertions**.

## Objective

- To systematically compare the performance of different SV callers — Manta, DELLY, LUMPY, BreakDancer, and BreakSeq2 — on simulated datasets generated by SURVIVOR and ART.   
- To explore how design variation in algorithms affects accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency as well as to identify each tool's strengths and weaknesses.
- To provide guidance for the selection or combination of SV callers in future.

## Methods

- **Data**: 10 simulated chr21 of GRCh38 with deletions and insertions (20–10,000 bp), generated using SURVIVOR and ART.
- **SV callers**: Manta, DELLY, LUMPY, Breakdancer.
- **Metrics**: Precision, accuracy, recall, specificity, F1-score, and usability.
